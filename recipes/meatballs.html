  <h2>Description</h3>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 lb ground pork</li>
    <li>1 slice of ginger</li>
    <li>1 scallion</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>3 tblsp plain breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>1 tblsp Shaoxing wine</li>
    <li>1 tblsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tblsp oyster sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp white pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp five spice powder</li>
    <li> 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Transfer the ground pork to a large mixing bowl. Add the minced ginger and scallions, egg, breadcrumbs, Shaoxing wine, 
      light soy sauce, oyster sauce, white pepper, five spice powder, cornstarch, and water.</li>
    <li>Whip everything in one direction for about 10 minutes, until the meat mixture resembles a paste. </li>
    <li>Heat enough oil to submerge the meatballs in a small, deep pot (a small pot requires less oil) to 350 degrees F/175 degrees C. 
      Just be sure there’s enough oil to cook the meatballs evenly, but that the oil will not overflow during frying.</li>
    <li>With oiled hands, divide the meat mixture into 8 to 9 equal portions and shape each into a ball. Carefully lower the meatballs one at a time into the heated oil, and fry in batches (2 minutes per batch) 
      until they’re evenly golden brown. Remove the par-cooked meatballs with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
    <li>Cook thoroughly in sauce of choice. </li>
  </ol>
